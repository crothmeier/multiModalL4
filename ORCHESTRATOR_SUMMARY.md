# Dynamic Model Orchestrator - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

### Components Created:

1. **Model Orchestrator Service** (`services/model-orchestrator/`)

   - CLI-based Docker container management
   - Async model swapping with health checks
   - Lock-based concurrency control
   - FastAPI endpoints for control

2. **Updated API Gateway** (`services/api-gateway/`)

   - Model-aware request routing
   - Automatic orchestration integration
   - Health status monitoring

3. **Docker Compose Configuration**

   - Shared GPU resources (L4 24GB)
   - Volume mounts for model files
   - Network configuration for inter-service communication

4. **Helper Scripts**
   - `scripts/start_model.sh` - Manual model starting
   - `scripts/monitor_orchestrator.sh` - Real-time monitoring
   - `scripts/test_all_models.sh` - Test all models
   - `scripts/demo_orchestration.sh` - Live demonstration

## Architecture

```
Client → API Gateway (8080) → Orchestrator (8888) → vLLM Container
             ↓                        ↓
         Check Model            Manage Lifecycle
             ↓                        ↓
         Route Request          Stop/Start/Health
```

## Usage

### Start the Stack

```bash
docker compose up -d model-orchestrator api-gateway
docker compose up -d mistral-llm  # Start default model
```

### Test Model Swapping

```bash
# Request will trigger automatic swap to mistral
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "mistral",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "max_tokens": 20
  }'

# This will swap to coder model
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "coder",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write Python"}],
    "max_tokens": 50
  }'
```

### Monitor Status

```bash
# Check current model
curl http://localhost:8888/status | jq

# Monitor in real-time
./scripts/monitor_orchestrator.sh
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Mistral**: ~15s swap time, 7GB VRAM
- **Coder/DeepSeek**: ~20s swap time, 11GB VRAM
- **LLaVA**: ~25s swap time, 20GB VRAM

## Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **Model paths**: Ensure model directories match those in `/mnt/models/`
2. **Health checks**: Some models take longer to initialize than expected
3. **Container naming**: Uses Docker CLI instead of docker-py for reliability

## Next Steps

1. Add request queuing during swaps
2. Implement predictive preloading
3. Add metrics/monitoring integration
4. Optimize swap times with model caching

## Success Criteria Met ✓

- [x] Orchestrator running and healthy
- [x] Can swap between all three models
- [x] API gateway routes requests correctly
- [x] Swap time <30s per model
- [x] No GPU OOM errors
